# **Face Detection Based Automatic Curtain**
# introduction
With technological advancement there are AC’s available which automatically maintains a particular temperature of the room even during owner’s absence . In case the owner forgets to close the curtain before he leaves for his office then sunlight can easily penetrate through the glass and make the room warmer.As a result the AC will consume more power to maintain the temperature set by the user.
So we thought of making an automatic motorised curtain which opens only after detecting a human face in the room. we are already done with the prototype and we are sure that its real time application will significantly decrease the electricity bill generated.
